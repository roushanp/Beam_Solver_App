# Beam_Solver_App
An app designed to reduce tremendous calculations of solving beams to just clicking few buttons

1.Introduction:-
This app is designed in such a way that it can access a beam that is supported by different supports and is acted upon by different loads and provide us with the slope, bending moment , shear force and deflection of the beam. It also gives the support reactions as well.
All this information helps us in analysing the beam and identifying critical parts such as where the beam is most deflected etc.

2.Project requirements:-

 (a).Structural analysis concepts particularly related with beams.
For this we have watched videos of an introductory course on structural analysis.

 (b).Python programming language and its libraries are used in making this app.

 (c).Python library used here is Sympy. This python library is used in solving beam bending problems, solving both determinate as well as indeterminate beams. Specifically, its beam module is used for this purpose.

 (d).Matplotlib, this python library is used for plotting and applying grid over plots.

 (e).Kivy and KivyMD, Kivy  is an Open source Python library for rapid development of applications . It is a platform independent gui building tool in python. Kivy runs on Linux, Windows, OS X, Android, iOS, and Raspberry Pi. We can run the same code on all supported platforms.
